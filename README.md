modelr
======


A model renderer written by me to learn OpenGL and 3D graphics.


Features
--------


* Uses modern OpenGL (4.4+)
* VBO/VAO-meshes
* Materials
    * Diffuse maps
    * Normal maps


Planned features
----------------


* !!! Material mesh sorting
* !!! Transparent material support
* !!! Mesh vertex attribute indexing
* Multiple textures per material
* Classes for different mesh types
* View frustum culling (GLSL-side, if possible)
* SSAO
* Occlusion culling, if possible
* Dynamic terrain loading/rendering, preferrably from heightmap
* More optimizations
* Debugging helpers - trajectories
* Maybe physics like collisions/gravity
